# **Methodology**

This thesis uses Case Study as the main analytical tool or method to explain and sustain my own understanding and reflection of the co-evolution between human and digital technology. More specifically applied to cultural aspects of everyday life co-evolving in dependance to the technology available but also to the geographical location in which this co-evolving conditions take place. This ideas are sustained in cohesion with Katherine Hayle's notion of the Posthuman, Actor-Network-Theory (A-N-T) of Bruno Latour and Creative Geography theory based on **pending**.

Novelty of this Thesis lies in perception and analysis on the evolution of cultural expression online (digital culture expression) perceived through the limitations of what I define as _"Digital Borders"_

First chapter deals with the definition and description of Digital Borders on the terms specified for this thesis (check Glossary for full definition). The scope of the chapter uses Psychogeography, 'an exploration of urban environments with emphasis on drifting techniques' (**someone**) to perceive and explore the Internet spatially, as one would do with an urban space.

Inspired by computer science abstraction rules, each chapter of this thesis is self-contained to work as detachable blocks that co-relate and create a whole analysis entity but which on their own go in depth to analyse in detail aspects of Digital Borders, Digital Culture and co-evolution of human and technology under Iterative, Ethnographic and Creative Geography methods.

The cultural elements to research in this thesis share in common Mexican elements of representation. This elements related to Mexican culture are grounded on personal experience and expertise on the struggle to access specific online content while abroad. After moving geographically out from Mexico to the United Kingdom, this struggle became an everyday reality, which in return created an opportunity for analysis on the changes and effects (Digital Borders have on the individual) perceived through 4 years of living abroad.

At the same time, Creative Practice is the main outcome though which this analysis takes form, since each chapter analysis and development permeates my prototyping and final creation of a Digital Media Project. This said, on the final chapter of this Thesis, a description of expression in my creative project looks to describe in detail the impact or much rather the co-relation between technology impacting digital culture but also digital culture impacting our use of that technology. Location and dislocation of place allows to perceive and further understand our human relationship with technology in elements of everyday life.
